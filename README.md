# What is Gap Effect?
The "gap effect" in learning refers to the phenomenon where a temporary interruption or break in learning can lead to better retention and understanding of the material. This can occur when there is a gap of time between initial learning and subsequent review or testing of the material. The theory behind the gap effect is that the brain needs time to process and condolidate new information, and that this process is facilitated by taking a break and allowing the information to "sink in". 1
